# Geometry Wars

## Description

An application which allows a user to control a player character's movement and
fire bullets from the player character. Enemies will spawn at a fixed rate on
the screen, will be destroyed and split into smaller enemies when they collide
with something, and will destroy the player character and bullets if they
collide with them. A score is kept for the game which is incremented when an
enemies is destroyed.

The application reads configuration data, such as window settings, font family,
player position, enemy colour, and bullet speed from a configuration file.

The user is given access to an internal GUI that can modify the properties of
entities in the game and the user is also able to pause or quit the game.
